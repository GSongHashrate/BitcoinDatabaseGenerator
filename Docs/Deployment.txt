. Increment the version in <...>\Sources\BitcoinDatabaseGenerator\Properties\AssemblyInfo.cs. Increment both AssemblyVersion and AssemblyFileVersion.

. Update the NuGetPackages as needed.

. Switch to Debug. Clean Solution / Rebuild Solution.

. Run all VS tests.

. Switch to Release. Clean Solution / Rebuild Solution.

. Run all VS tests.

. Rebuild the Bitcoin Database. Run:
    <...>\Sources\BitcoinDatabaseGenerator\bin\Release\BitcoinDatabaseGenerator.exe /BlockchainPath F:\Blockchain\Full\blocks /SQLDbName BitcoinBlockchain /DropDB
  Save the output (it will be copied to log.txt if all validations succeed).

. Run the auto-validation procedure:
    <...>\Sources\BitcoinDatabaseGenerator\bin\Release\BitcoinDatabaseGenerator.exe /RunValidation /SQLDbName BitcoinBlockchain
  This will take a while. The attempt on 9/26/2015 took 1564 seconds.

. Verify the database that was rebuilt against https://blockchain.info
    - Verify a few blocks. If the new code changes address blockchain format changes target some blocks that have that format change. 
      Use the SQL view: View_BlockAggregated
    - Verify a few transactions. If the new code changes address blockchain format changes target some transactions that have that format change. 
      Use the SQL view: View_TransactionAggregated

. Assuming all is OK, copy the output you saved earlier to:
    <...>\Docs\Logs\log.txt

. Consider regenerating the baseline files used for validation. 
    - In class AutoValidator method ValidateDataAgainstBaseline increase the constant maxBlockchainFileId so that it covers more blockchain files. 
      Do not set the maxBlockchainFileId to the last file since that may be incomplete.
    - Rerun the validation and copy the new dataset files over the baseline files.

. Close and reopen VS. Switch to Release. Clean Solution / Rebuild Solution.

. Collect the following files from 
  <...>\Sources\BitcoinDatabaseGenerator\bin\Release to a Separate folder and prepare a ZIP file:
        AdoNetHelpers.dll
        BitcoinBlockchain.dll
        BitcoinDatabaseGenerator.exe
        BitcoinDataLayerAdoNet.dll
        Microsoft.Threading.Tasks.dll
        Microsoft.Threading.Tasks.Extensions.Desktop.dll
        Microsoft.Threading.Tasks.Extensions.dll
        ResharperAnnotations.dll
        ZeroHelpers.dll
        ValidationBaseline\01_BlockchainData.txt
        ValidationBaseline\02_BlockchainFilesData.txt
        ValidationBaseline\03_BlockSampleData.txt
        ValidationBaseline\04_TransactionSampleData.txt
        ValidationBaseline\05_TransactionInputSampleData.txt
        ValidationBaseline\06_TransactionOutputSampleData.txt

. Publish the new Release on GitHub.
